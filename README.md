jquery-navigation-collections
=============================

Collection of ideas for jquery single page website navigations. So far I 've got two.

Circles
-------
	This simple style can be used for personal pages and other pages need very subtle. when you click a circle it will cover the whole screen with its color leaving empty its place. When you click another circle it will shrink the other circle and then expand the clicked circle.

Tiles
------
	I created this a long time ago in inspiration to windows tiles (eventhough not much resemblances to it).
